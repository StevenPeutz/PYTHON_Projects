The goal I set for myself was to get everythng working, create a model that predicted at least somewhat better than chance alone, and upload it to Kaggle.<br> I hope this is useful to newbe kagglers like myself._\n",

Obviously this requires some setup but the advantages are that you know where you stand when doing datascience projects oustide of kaggle. The setup is made quite easy by means of an application called 'anaconda navigator' which also has other benefits so I stronlgy suggest using this if going for your own setup.\n",
